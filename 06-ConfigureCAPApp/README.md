  > the screenshot was created when the repository was still private. that's why the fork button appears to be disabled. 

8. Choose your user as destination for the fork. 

    ![Choose user for fork](./images/fork-repo-user.png)

    You should now have the following repository: github.com/**YourUser**/s4hana-btp-extension-devops. 

9.	Choose *Terminal -> New Terminal* in the menu on the top of your screen.

    ![Open Terminal](./images/dev-cap-app-5.png)
 
10. In the opened terminal go to projects folder with executing

   cd projects
   ``` 

11. Clone your forked sample GitHub repository for this mission.

16. Build the Multi-Target Application Archive (MTA Archive) by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    mbt build -e trial.mtaext
    ```
    Note - for live environment we can use the below command instead
    ```
    mbt build -e live.mtaext
    ```

>this will produce a .mtar file in the mta_archives directory. Some of the values for the service instance creation depend on the environment you are deploying to, that's why the *-e* for *extension* is used here. 

17. Deploy the application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/BusinessPartnerVerification_1.2.0.mtar
    ```

    This will trigger the deployment to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime including the creation of the necessary service instances and service bindings to the corresponding apps.
